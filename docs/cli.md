# Process Lab CLI

The CLI is a client of a running Process Lab server. It never opens the
SQLite database; `processlab serve` is the process that owns `--db` and the
domain connection described in [`internal/studio/store.go:101`](../internal/studio/store.go#L101).

## Start the server

```bash
processlab serve
```

The server prints its address and serves the browser application and `/api/v1`
JSON API. Keep it running in one terminal, then use the client commands from
another. The client resolves the server in this order:

1. `--server <url>`;
2. `PROCESSLAB_ADDR`;
3. `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

The global `--timeout` controls one request and defaults to five minutes. It is
available before the command, for example:

```bash
processlab --server http://127.0.0.1:8080 --timeout 30s project list
```

## Output and exit codes

Successful data goes to stdout. Diagnostics go to stderr. `--json` writes the
complete machine-readable response for commands that return records; it can be
global or command-local. The client does not print progress or warnings into a
JSON response.

- `0` — command completed successfully;
- `1` — the server or domain refused a valid request;
- `2` — local usage, flag, file, JSON, or TSV input error;
- `3` — the server could not be reached.

Examples below assume the seeded server is running and that the selected
flowsheet is `1`. Each is an executable command; use `processlab help --json`
or the generated reference below to discover flags without contacting a
server.

## Top-level command examples

| Command | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `help` | `processlab help --json` |
| `serve` | `processlab serve --help` |
| `project` | `processlab project list` |
| `flow` | `processlab flow list` |
| `block` | `processlab block list --flow 1` |
| `wire` | `processlab wire list --flow 1` |
| `sim` | `processlab sim run --flow 1 --duration 1 --sample-time 0.1` |
| `analyze` | `processlab analyze channels --flow 1` |
| `roles` | `processlab roles show --flow 1` |
| `sweep` | `processlab sweep run --help` |
| `controller` | `processlab controller pid --help` |
| `ident` | `processlab ident estimate --help` |
| `study` | `processlab study show --help` |
| `nonlinear` | `processlab nonlinear register --help` |
| `export` | `processlab export --flow 1` |
| `log` | `processlab log --flow 1` |

Use a command's `--json` form for scripts. For example, these commands return
the project register and a simulation result without presentation formatting:

```bash
processlab project list --json
processlab sim show --flow 1 --json
```

The nonlinear workflows use persisted expression definitions. Register JSON on
stdin, pass a JSON linearization request file, or feed the EKF the same
time-plus-series TSV shape emitted by `sim run`:

```bash
processlab nonlinear register < definition.json
processlab nonlinear linearize --definition models/decay@1 --operating-point origin.json
processlab nonlinear ekf --definition models/decay@1 --estimator estimator.json < samples.tsv
```

See [`nonlinear-workflows.md`](nonlinear-workflows.md) for expression,
linearization, and EKF semantics.

## Declarative flowsheet documents

`flow dump` includes block and wire ids for reference. `flow apply` ignores
those ids and matches blocks by name. A rename edited into a document is an
add plus a remove, so use `flow rename` or `block set` when renaming a block.
An apply with no changes prints only `No changes.`; non-empty change sections
and wire counts are printed only when they contain changes.
