// Project and flowsheet lifecycle. These routes move whole sheets and whole
// projects; the block, connection and simulation handlers in server.go work
// inside the one sheet the caller already has open.
//
// Four response shapes appear below, and which one a handler uses follows
// from what the caller is left looking at:
//
//   - An operation that leaves the caller on a flowsheet answers with the
//     `workbench` fragment for that flowsheet, as every mutation in server.go
//     does.
//   - An operation on a project the caller is reading rather than editing —
//     renaming it from the register — answers with that project's register
//     row, because the register is not a workbench and must never be handed
//     one.
//   - An operation the client has already drawn for itself — dragging a tab
//     into a new place — answers 204, as moveBlock and moveBlocks do for the
//     same gesture on the canvas.
//   - Deleting a project answers with a redirect, because the page the caller
//     is looking at is the thing that stopped existing.
//
// A refusal here is never dressed as a workbench. renderFailure re-renders the
// sheet you are editing with a banner, which is right for an edit to that
// sheet and wrong for an operation whose subject may have just ceased to
// exist; these handlers answer the domain's own message with a status the
// client can branch on.

// renameProject renames a project and answers with the register's complete row
// collection.
//
// It used to answer with the `workbench` fragment, which was a trap. The
// workspace RenameProject returns opens the project's *first* flowsheet,
// because renaming a project says nothing about which sheet is open — so a
// caller on any other sheet who swapped that response into `#workbench` would
// find themselves moved to sheet one, and the register, which is not a
// workbench at all, had nothing it could do with the response but pick it
// apart with `hx-select`.
//
// Projects are listed by name, so replacing only the renamed row would leave
// it in its old position until reload. Answering with all rows preserves the
// canonical order while still avoiding the register shell and its totals,
// neither of which a rename changes. Nothing else calls this route.
