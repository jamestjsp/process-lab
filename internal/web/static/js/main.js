// The workbench entry point: it names the modules and the order the
// canvas is rebuilt in, and does nothing else.
//
// Loaded as type="module", which is deferred by definition. Deferred
// classic scripts and module scripts share one execution list ordered by
// document position, so menu.js still runs before this file — its
// ProcessLab.menu namespace is there for contextmenu.js to register
// against — and tabs.js still runs after it, layering its second menu
// region and its Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + arrow chord over these bindings.
//
// The flowsheet tab strip is not here. It began in app.js because the
// agent that wrote it did not own page.html and had nowhere else to put
// it; it now lives in tabs.js, next to the rename, drag and reorder
// gestures that share its geometry.
